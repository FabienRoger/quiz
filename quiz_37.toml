From the documentation of [NLLLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.NLLLoss.html#torch.nn.NLLLoss):
input has to be a Tensor of size either \\( (minibatch, C) \\) or \\( (minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K) \\) with \\( Kâ‰¥1 \\) for the K-dimensional case. 
The latter is useful for higher dimension inputs, such as computing NLL loss per-pixel for 2D images.
